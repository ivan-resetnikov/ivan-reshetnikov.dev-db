    "description": "Terrain blending algorithm that uses colors as index for a LUT of materials, extending the limit of possible materials to more that 4 trillion. Implemented though a custom corner-based blending algorithm, allowing for support of dynamic materials (i.e. not just diffuse + ORM maps, but fully featured custom shaders) making hardware the limit.",
